 ## Intro

Monarch Money Toolkit extends the web version of [Monarch Money](https://monarchmoney.com) with features, styles and tweeks not found in the current offering.
With inspiration stemming from the [You Need A Budget Toolkit](https://www.toolkitforynab.com/) and scaffolding based on the [Chrome Extension Boilerplate](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite?tab=readme-ov-file).

> [!WARNING]
> This is an <b>ALPHA</b> release. This version contains no features that alter your Monarch Money data but, like any 3rd party extension, it could cause Monarch Money UI issues. If you encounter any issues please open a [ticket](https://github.com/dandurland/monarch-money-toolkit/issues) with the details.
> I plan to relase this to the [Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions) and [Mozilla Add-On Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox) once it has been in the wild for a bit and other features have been aded.

2. Unzip the file
3. Open Chrome and type or paste `chrome://extensions` in the navigation bar
4. Enable developer mode by clicking the toggle switch next to <B>Developer mode</B>
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you unzipped the extension
